## Testing

Manual testing only: import `postman_collection.json` into Postman (file included) or use the `curl` examples in the document to test all endpoints.

Postman endpoints:
- POST   /api/employees      (create)
- GET    /api/employees      (get all)
- GET    /api/employees/:id  (get one)
- PUT    /api/employees/:id  (update)
- DELETE /api/employees/:id  (delete)
